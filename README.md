# Lil Patchy Saver

This web app displays and stores web pages captured by the [Lil Patchy web extension](https://github.com/therealjeffg/lil-patchy).

The extension captures the following information when `saving` a page:

* a full page screenshot of the page
* some web page meta-data 
* the time of the capture
* [ eventually ] the full article text and additional text content from the page.

Lil Patchy Saver listens for pages captured by the extension and stores them to WNFS.
