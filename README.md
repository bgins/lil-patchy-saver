# Lil Patchy Viewer

This web app displays and stores web pages captured by the [Lil Patchy web extension](https://github.com/therealjeffg/lil-patchy).

The extension captures the following information when `saving` a page:

* a full page screenshot of the page
* some web page meta-data 
* the time of the capture
* [ eventually ] the full article text and additional text content from the page.

Lil Patchy Viewer listens for pages captured by the extension and displays them. Eventually, it will store the pages to IPFS and WNFS.
